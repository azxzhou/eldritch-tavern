start_b30be017		(Thursday evening, 596 PD. Later known as Vanquishing Day.)	game/script.rpy	11	"[what]"
start_08c3d395	pat	Hey, tavernkeep!	game/script.rpy	13	pat "[what]"
start_05f341c4		A shout from across the room jolts you back to attention.	game/script.rpy	15	"[what]"
start_e81cd252	pat	Another round of beers for us!	game/script.rpy	17	pat "[what]"
start_7cce940b		You glance across your absurdly crowded tavern floor towards the source of the shout - an older-looking paladin who looks like he hasn't shaved in a week.	game/script.rpy	19	"[what]"
start_d0a1a72f		Given what he and everyone else are celebrating tonight, he probably hasn't. 	game/script.rpy	21	"[what]"
start_f72423ce		A wave of your hand satisfies him enough to turn right back to his rowdy teammates, and you duck back into the kitchen to see how swamped your enchanted dishwasher is. 	game/script.rpy	23	"[what]"
start_47a51e1a		So far it seems to still be chugging along.	game/script.rpy	30	"[what]"
start_31cb579a		The dirty dishes bin isn't stacked halfway to the ceiling like it was two hours ago, and there are more than enough clean beer mugs for you to quickly grab an armful and head back outside to the beer tap. 	game/script.rpy	32	"[what]"
start_f2a53f79		You catch a few snatches of conversation from the adventurers sitting near the bar counter as you busy yourself pouring all the drinks. 	game/script.rpy	34	"[what]"
start_c1ce4bce	pat	Man, I never thought that Dark Lord of all things would bring pretty much all of us adventurers together.	game/script.rpy	36	pat "[what]"
start_a830cdde	pat	Oh, I'm sure half of our lot will be back to pulling each other's hair out in less than a week.	game/script.rpy	37	pat "[what]"
start_d7f641ca	pat	But you're right, it's nice for so many of us to celebrate together for once.	game/script.rpy	38	pat "[what]"
start_9427c39e	pat	Ain't that right! Cheers to our short-lived harmony, then!	game/script.rpy	39	pat "[what]"
start_b3130945		You carefully balance the now-full beer mugs in your arms and slip out from behind the counter, making your way through the throng of customers towards the paladin's table. 	game/script.rpy	41	"[what]"
start_600fbf9c	pld	Finally, the beer angel is here!	game/script.rpy	48	pld "[what]"
start_852c2ec7		The scruffy paladin roars in delight as he sees you approach.	game/script.rpy	50	"[what]"
start_fa931105	pld	 You should sit and celebrate with us for a while! This occasion is special, lemme tell ya.	game/script.rpy	52	pld "[what]"
start_24af39d0		One of his buddies - a tough-looking tiefling barbarian with an eyepatch and a giant axe propped against the wall behind her - notices your hesitant expression and grins at you, gesturing at a figure in sorcerer's robes slumped over at the far end of the table.	game/script.rpy	54	"[what]"
start_286acbec	war	Penelope passed out right after we asked you for drinks.	game/script.rpy	56	war "[what]"
start_55d946eb	war	She'll be fine - Eleonora cast Lesser Restoration on her, she's just dead asleep - but we'd hate for a drink to go to waste, you know?	game/script.rpy	58	war "[what]"
start_bdfcfc2d		The barbarian cheers loudly at your response.	game/script.rpy	67	"[what]"
start_05e955a9	war	The more the merrier! You deserve a break after all everyone in here has put you through at one point or another.	game/script.rpy	68	war "[what]"
start_40e96076		As everyone shuffles around to make a spot for you on the benches, a elven cleric sitting at the far end of the table raises a very obviously judgy eyebrow.	game/script.rpy	70	"[what]"
start_91927614	whm	Yeah, and next week you'll be back in here causing more property damage for our poor tavernkeep here. Like clockwork.	game/script.rpy	72	whm "[what]"
start_4e4308c6	war	Hey, I'm not too bad, am I? At least I pay for it afterward!	game/script.rpy	74	war "[what]"
start_56d13bcd	pld	Oh, come on. If you don't want to drink, at least sit for a few minutes.	game/script.rpy	81	pld "[what]"
start_99780e5e	pld	I haven't seen you so much as lean against the counter the whole time I've been here, and it's well past sunset already!	game/script.rpy	83	pld "[what]"
start_61471319	you	Thanks for the concern, but I'l be fine. I worked food service back in the capital, and that was way worse than this.	game/script.rpy	85	you "[what]"
start_76b52758	nin	So did I.	game/script.rpy	87	nin "[what]"
start_89b472ea		The dimuinitive rabbit-eared rogue pipes up from the middle of the group, idly flipping their fork in the air.	game/script.rpy	89	"[what]"
start_dbe6dc28	nin	I would rather take on a herd of wilding beasts alone than deal with that again.	game/script.rpy	91	nin "[what]"
start_36fcbdf8		Both of you exchange a look of understanding.	game/script.rpy	93	"[what]"
start_1fd9670d		The barbarian roars with laughter, downing half her mug of beer in one gulp.	game/script.rpy	100	"[what]"
start_f53eadec	war	Remember what happened to ol' Artarias? He actually got arrested by the Guild after they had to step into the matter.	game/script.rpy	102	war "[what]"
start_fc8d46d2	war	You ever see that happen before?	game/script.rpy	104	war "[what]"
start_81d12d2b	nin	Arguably, that was partially the owner's fault.	game/script.rpy	106	nin "[what]"
start_89b472ea_1		The dimuinitive rabbit-eared rogue pipes up from the middle of the group, idly flipping their fork in the air.	game/script.rpy	108	"[what]"
start_d6e7b152	nin	Great food, but didn't have the chops to be a tavernkeep here. Lots of valleyvoid folk don't realize owning a tavern here is more of a leadership position than anything.	game/script.rpy	110	nin "[what]"
start_9a3e1599	you	You're right. So don't get the impression that this chat entitles any of you to special treatment, yeah?	game/script.rpy	112	you "[what]"
start_732f9c89		It's your turn to arch an eyebrow at the group.	game/script.rpy	114	"[what]"
start_b0cfa6ef	you	Speaking of which, I think I hear another group hollering for food back there.	game/script.rpy	116	you "[what]"
start_3c5e8ecb	whm	Ah, wait. We haven't told you the story of what happened at the Dark Lord's keep.	game/script.rpy	123	whm "[what]"
start_a06c016d	whm	Have you heard the full recounting at all yet?	game/script.rpy	125	whm "[what]"
start_5e485957	you	Just bits and pieces here and there.	game/script.rpy	127	you "[what]"
start_24be213c	whm	I imagine you must be dying of curiosity, then?	game/script.rpy	129	whm "[what]"
start_80047ab6		The cleric doesn't wait for your response.	game/script.rpy	131	"[what]"
start_23fe281e	whm	After Tobias' group of spies tracked the Dark Lord to their hideout - very cleverly glamoured spire right in the middle of the Greystone Plains, by the way - they put out the call to every single adventurer in the valley.	game/script.rpy	133	whm "[what]"
start_4db61238	whm	Gave a time and place, said to be there to fight the Dark Lord or not at all.	game/script.rpy	135	whm "[what]"
start_5f16c4d8	pld	And wouldn't you know it, damn near every single one of us showed up!	game/script.rpy	137	pld "[what]"
start_e6df0832	pld	Even the Guild didn't have that good of a turnout when building this damn place!	game/script.rpy	139	pld "[what]"
start_c5f21b78	war	Well, we definitely don't know the ins and outs of it all. There had to be several hundred of us in there, and the Dark Lord was surrounded by at least ten adventurer crews our size or bigger.	game/script.rpy	146	war "[what]"
start_fd68b0c6	war	It was definitely a fierce battle, that's for sure.	game/script.rpy	148	war "[what]"
start_6ef77732	nin	Something felt off about the whole thing, though.	game/script.rpy	150	nin "[what]"
start_56732fec		You strain to hear their next words above the general din of the room.	game/script.rpy	152	"[what]"
start_f604a3ae	nin	They didn't fight like any other ego-bloated person I've taken down. It seemed more like they were fighting to... protect someone.	game/script.rpy	154	nin "[what]"
start_c0f844f5	whm	Protect their stranglehold over the land, more like. They've been sucking the life out of the earth the whole time if the mana levels in the Greystone Plains are any indication.	game/script.rpy	156	whm "[what]"
start_184c32e8	nin	But then why were their last words an apology?	game/script.rpy	158	nin "[what]"
start_9c01c26f	pld	I thought they were 'I'm happy'.	game/script.rpy	160	pld "[what]"
start_49fb1918	war	And I didn't hear anything at all! I guess we'll never be sure.	game/script.rpy	162	war "[what]"
start_8244a780		The group waves as you head back to the bar counter, and the fanciful story quickly slips from your mind as you are once again swamped with food and drink orders. 	game/script.rpy	169	"[what]"
start_e4cd4fbd		Several hours later, you feel your thoughts beginning to fray at the seams. A good chunk of your customers have already filtered out, but there are still three or four tables who seem intent on permanently moving into your tavern. 	game/script.rpy	171	"[what]"
start_4f0bf841		You're not sure what would be best - standing on a chair and yelling at them to leave, or start aggresively closing up shop around them. You can never tell what will work on adventurers. 	game/script.rpy	173	"[what]"
yell_56e4480e		No one notices you laying a spare plank down on your bar counter and clambering onto the surface, but everyone starts paying attention after you start shouting. 	game/script.rpy	182	"[what]"
yell_1bd7871d	you	THE TAVERN IS NOW CLOSED. GET OUT OF HERE, I'M FUCKING TIRED.	game/script.rpy	184	you "[what]"
yell_f41acd45		Surprisingly, this proves to be very effective. The few people who haven't settled their tabs with you quickly do so, and within five minutes everyone is out of the place. 	game/script.rpy	186	"[what]"
close_e4c5ff01		Most of the groups get the message once you start putting the chairs and benches on top of the tables, but it takes you treating the last group as permanent fixtures in your tavern and spraying cleaner on them to get them to leave. 	game/script.rpy	191	"[what]"
close_b9ef8689		After putting all the leftovers in the icebox, setting the cleaner runeba loose on the tavern floor, and loading up the magicked dishwasher with all the dirty dishes, you're ready to finally head upstairs and collapse into bed. 	game/script.rpy	196	"[what]"
close_a6fedeee		Something odd tugs at the back of your mind as you begin to climb the stairs.	game/script.rpy	198	"[what]"
close_b2c71d2f		You... forgot something at the bar? Yes, you definitely did.	game/script.rpy	200	"[what]"
close_cf86bdd5		Best to go back for it now. 	game/script.rpy	202	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_d0000447		You scour the bar thoroughly, even peeking behind the barrels of beer under the counter, but can't seem to find what you left behind.	game/script.rpy	207	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_441cd064		What was it you were looking for, anyway? 	game/script.rpy	209	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_7749cc51	you	Whatever. That's a problem for tomorrow.	game/script.rpy	211	you "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_2d9d94bd		You stand back up only to be met with a strange shadowy figure that quickly consumes your vision. 	game/script.rpy	213	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_1defd77c	eld	Where are you?	game/script.rpy	222	eld "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_28a14f88		You hear a sad, pitiful voice crying inside your head.	game/script.rpy	224	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_05cf47c0	eld	Where did you go?	game/script.rpy	226	eld "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_63c8a3cb		You try to tear your gaze away from the shadowy figure.	game/script.rpy	228	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_63a91763		You can't see properly. Shadowy tendrils start to creep into your vision. 	game/script.rpy	230	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_0219eae6		You have to stop staring.	game/script.rpy	232	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_82ecb86d		You have to stop.	game/script.rpy	239	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_7ce5ce33		You can't stop.	game/script.rpy	241	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_82ecb86d_1		You have to stop.	game/script.rpy	243	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_7ce5ce33_1		You can't stop.	game/script.rpy	245	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_b3375c6f		Where did they go? Why aren't they here?	game/script.rpy	247	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_8f9bced7		You're scared. You're scared. You're -	game/script.rpy	249	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_6d5a6316		A loud crash from somewhere in the distance jolts you back to reality. The pressure on your skull suddenly lifts. 	game/script.rpy	251	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_0b54e747		You blink in the sudden brightness of the tavern, jerking your head towards the source of the sound to see the rabbit-eared rogue from earlier staring at you in surprise. 	game/script.rpy	253	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_f4f4813c	nin	Sorry, I forgot something in here. I didn't see you, but the door was unlocked.	game/script.rpy	255	nin "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_20d52f74	nin	Um...	game/script.rpy	257	nin "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_d8aedae3		They trail off awkwardly.	game/script.rpy	259	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_e53f0f37	nin	I'll go. Good night.	game/script.rpy	261	nin "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_8106090f		They scurry out the door, and you walk over to lock it, still a bit shaken.	game/script.rpy	263	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_82d16685		You must be more tired than you thought. Maybe you shouldn't open for business tomorrow. 	game/script.rpy	265	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_ba8d21e7		You don't sleep well that night.	game/script.rpy	272	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_8a3d90cb		The shadowy figure drifts in and out of your dreams, crying out for someone.	game/script.rpy	274	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_a17afb54		You wake to your escaper alarm beeping angrily at you from across the room. 	game/script.rpy	276	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_b4fc4920	you	Yes, yes, I'm up.	game/script.rpy	278	you "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_d9af3d44		You sigh, forcing yourself out of bed and switching the alarm off. The escaper beeps grumpily and floats back over to your nightstand.	game/script.rpy	280	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_606a36ea		Even if you don't plan to be open for business, you still have errands to run.	game/script.rpy	282	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_89844907		So with some effort, you drag yourself through your morning routine, heading back downstairs.	game/script.rpy	284	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_404baa60		You noticed you were running low on evoker spice last night (the evoker stew you put on the menu last week has proven to be surprisingly popular).	game/script.rpy	286	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_ee1f7741		You also need to figure out what to do with the massive amount of chicken mushrooms that grew in your storeroom after a stray spell missed its intended target during a tavern brawl last week.	game/script.rpy	288	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_1e8fb839		Speaking of which, the Guild is bound to have released a new list of approved foodstuffs already, since it's already well past noon - 	game/script.rpy	290	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_9632c7f9	you	?!	game/script.rpy	292	you "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_c342b67d		You come to a sudden stop as you realize that the rabbit-eared rogue from yesterday is casually standing in the middle of your tavern. Didn't you lock the door last night?	game/script.rpy	294	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_9c6b8e7d		Before you can react, the rogue surges forward and grabs your shoulders. 	game/script.rpy	296	"[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_d55fa206	nin	You saw it too, didn't you? Last night, after everyone left.	game/script.rpy	298	nin "[what]"
go_back_to_the_bar_counter_aeec4bb1	nin	The shadowy figure. The voice in your head. Calling out for someone.	game/script.rpy	300	nin "[what]"
